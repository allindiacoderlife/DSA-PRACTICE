# Problem 1

289. Game of Life

According to Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

The board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

    Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
    Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
    Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
    Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The next state of the board is determined by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state of the m x n grid board. In this process, births and deaths occur simultaneously.

Given the current state of the board, update the board to reflect its next state.

Note that you do not need to return anything.



Example 1:

![Game of Life](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/26/grid1.jpg)

Input: board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]

Example 2:

![Game of Life](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/26/grid2.jpg)

Input: board = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: [[1,1],[1,1]]



Constraints:

    m == board.length
    n == board[i].length
    1 <= m, n <= 25
    board[i][j] is 0 or 1.



Follow up:

    Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
    In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border). How would you address these problems?

# Problem 2

1010. Pairs of Songs With Total Durations Divisible by 60

You are given a list of songs where the ith song has a duration of time[i] seconds.

Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by 60. Formally, we want the number of indices i, j such that i < j with (time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0.



Example 1:

Input: time = [30,20,150,100,40]
Output: 3
Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:
(time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180
(time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120
(time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60

Example 2:

Input: time = [60,60,60]
Output: 3
Explanation: All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is divisible by 60.


Constraints:

    1 <= time.length <= 6 * 104
    1 <= time[i] <= 500

# Problem 3

18. 4Sum

Given an array nums of n integers, return an array of all the unique quadruplets [nums[a], nums[b], nums[c], nums[d]] such that:

    0 <= a, b, c, d < n
    a, b, c, and d are distinct.
    nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] + nums[d] == target

You may return the answer in any order.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,0,-1,0,-2,2], target = 0
Output: [[-2,-1,1,2],[-2,0,0,2],[-1,0,0,1]]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2], target = 8
Output: [[2,2,2,2]]



Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 200
    -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
    -109 <= target <= 109


# Problem 5

45. Jump Game II

You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n. You are initially positioned at nums[0].

Each element nums[i] represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index i. In other words, if you are at nums[i], you can jump to any nums[i + j] where:

    0 <= j <= nums[i] and
    i + j < n

Return the minimum number of jumps to reach nums[n - 1]. The test cases are generated such that you can reach nums[n - 1].



Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,3,0,1,4]
Output: 2



Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 104
    0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
    It's guaranteed that you can reach nums[n - 1].
