# Problem 1

11. Container With Most Water

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

Example 1:

Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Example 2:

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1

Constraints:

    n == height.length
    2 <= n <= 105
    0 <= height[i] <= 104

    Hint

Given an m x n matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

Example 1:

Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]

Example 2:

Input: matrix = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12]]
Output: [1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]

Constraints:

    m == matrix.length
    n == matrix[i].length
    1 <= m, n <= 10
    -100 <= matrix[i][j] <= 100

# Problem 3

48. Rotate Image

You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.



Example 1:

![Rotate Image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/28/mat1.jpg)

Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]

Example 2:

![Rotate Image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/28/mat2.jpg)

Input: matrix = [[5,1,9,11],[2,4,8,10],[13,3,6,7],[15,14,12,16]]
Output: [[15,13,2,5],[14,3,4,1],[12,6,8,9],[16,7,10,11]]



Constraints:

    n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length
    1 <= n <= 20
    -1000 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1000


# Problem 4

79. Word Search

Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.



Example 1:

![Word Search](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/word2.jpg)

Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCCED"
Output: true

Example 2:

![Word Search](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/word-1.jpg)

Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "SEE"
Output: true

Example 3:

![Word Search](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/15/word3.jpg)

Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCB"
Output: false

# Problem 5

16. 3Sum Closest

Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.

Return the sum of the three integers.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,0], target = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0).



Constraints:

    3 <= nums.length <= 500
    -1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
    -104 <= target <= 104
